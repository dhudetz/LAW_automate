RE: Unemployment Compensation Clinic

Dear {name},

This letter is regarding your recent contact with our office requesting information about Unemployment Compensation Benefits. During the clinic appointment, the Volunteer advised you regarding your case and provided guidance on how you should proceed.

Brief advice was provided, and the Volunteer has indicated that representation is not required. I am enclosing our Client Grievance Procedure, which provides a process you can follow if you are dissatisfied with the decision to close your case. If you have any questions or a new legal issue, please contact Legal Action at (855) 947-2529.



Best,

Marlen
